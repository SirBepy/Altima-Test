#Altima Test

##Opening the file
To run the project simply run the index.html
It would be preffered if the file was open in a server (local server is fine), but it 
works even without running it in a server.

##Using the page
The user can either chose to use one of the 3 provided examples, 
or use his/her own example by chosing the 4th option in the "Chose a JSON file" section.
The user is then allowed to use the "Extra options" to change the output around. 
The extra options was done voluntarily. ssss
